\chapter{Open Source Logic Synthesis Tools}\label{chap:open-source}
\gls{tinygarble} offers a generic methodology for generating \acrfull{gc} that is transparent to the underlying logic synthesis tool.
To show this point, we demonstrate an implementation of \gls{tinygarble} using the Yosys \cite{tool:Yosys} and ABC \cite{tool:ABC} logic synthesis toolchain for circuit generation.
Both of these tools are open-source and available online.
We compare the performance of the commercial logic synthesis tool, i.e., \gls{synopsys-dc}, with this open-source synthesis toolchain.
ABC is an academic package developed at the University of California Berkeley.
Yosys is a logic synthesis tool which calls ABC for its technology mapping.
The \acrfull{hdl} inputs for describing both sequential and combinational circuits are written in the \gls{verilog} programming language.

We compare the performance of these open-source tools to the commercially available \gls{synopsys-dc}.
\tab{table:abc} reports the results.
For comparison purposes, we compute $\mathit{GTD}$ and $\mathit{MFE}$ using the \gls{netlist}s generated by \gls{synopsys-dc} as the reference.
For most of the benchmark functions, $\mathit{GTD}$s are either minuscule or zero which implies that the number of non-XOR gates in circuits generated by Yosys and by \gls{synopsys-dc} is almost similar.
Regarding memory footprint, different tools perform better for different benchmark functions.
These results show that \gls{tinygarble} is transparent to the underlying logic synthesis tool as long as the tool is up to date with respect to the known methods for logic minimization and mapping.
Since the logic synthesis tools perform a series of optimizations, they may use different (heuristic) algorithms for some of their internal steps which could lead to slightly different results.
A user can choose between the various synthesis tools based on their performance and availability.
