\begin{abstract}
Privacy-preserving computation is a standing challenge central to several modern-world applications which require computing on sensitive data. Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) refers to provably secure techniques aiming to address this challenge by enabling multiple parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their private inputs. The most promising two-party SFE method is called the Garbled Circuit (GC) Protocol introduced by Andrew Yao. The protocol is built upon representing the function as a Boolean circuit and encrypting/communicating at logic gate level. Despite several key progresses in GC, efficiency and scalability of the available methods are limited by the naive circuit representation as a directed acyclic graph, and ad-hoc logic optimizations. In this work, we introduce TinyGarble, a novel automated methodology based on logic synthesis techniques for generating optimized Boolean circuits for GC protocol. Moreover, TinyGarble achieves an unprecedented level of compactness and scalability by using a sequential circuit description. The preliminary implementation of benchmark functions using TinyGarble demonstrates a high degree of memory-foot-print compactness as well as improvement in overall efficiency compared to results of existing automated tools. Our sequential description also enables us, for the first time, to design and realize a garbled processor to reduce the problem of private function evaluation to a conventional SFE problem. In addition, the garbled processor allows to develop applications in high-level languages and securely evaluate them which eliminates the need for Boolean circuit generation.
